  ## Description 
  In this project, I have created a README.md generator. The generator dynamically creates a professional README file for a user by using a command line application that takes in user inputs and choice selections using the Inquirer package. By using this generator, a potential user can now focus their time working on other aspects of their own projects as opposed to creating a readme file.
  
  ## Table of Contents 
  
  If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
  
  - [Installation](#installation)
  - [Usage](#usage)
  - [Credits](#credits)
  - [License](#license) 
  
  ## Installation 
  One must run my code which can be found on my GitHub page :https://github.com/AngelaFig/README.md-Generator
  
  
  ## Usage 
  Once equipped with code, open integrated terminal in index.js. Enter node index.js in terminal and, if successful, you will be presented with prompts to fill out your README.md
  
  Here is link to my screencastify recording wherein one can find a step by step tutorial on how to 
  run the application.
